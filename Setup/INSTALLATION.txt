Installation
Start with a working and updated version of Raspberry Pi OS. This install was tested
using Buster.

The installation script (Setup.sh) assumes a working Internet connection. Check the
connection before starting the installation. You probably want to make sure your system
is up to date:
>sudo apt update
>sudo apt upgrade

Copy the folder Setup to any reasonable location on your Raspberry system
(/home/pi/ is recommended). Change the permissions of Setup.sh to executable. 
Then execute Setup.sh.

Example (Assume the setup folder is on a USB drive called USB1)
>cp /media/pi/USB1/Setup /home/pi
>chmod u+x /home/pi/Setup/Setup.sh
>/home/pi/Setup/Setup.sh

Reboot after the installation.
